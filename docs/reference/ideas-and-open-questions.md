# Ideas & Open Questions (Appendix)

> This page collects **provisional ideas** and **open questions** about Phase Space. Nothing here is final; items may change or be removed as the design evolves.

## Ideas

- Time-accelerated pockets for NPC automation.
- Foldstone reactors with variable stability.
- SLISP extensions for ship autopilots.
- Pocket biomes.
- Procedurally generated folded megastructures.

## Open Questions

- How far should pocket physics diverge from realspace?
- Should contexts be allowed to override core time dilation rules?
- How will context conflict resolution work?
- Should Foldstones have durability and failure modes?
- How do we handle long-range multiplayer latency?
