# Phase Space — Vision

Phase Space is a universal simulation engine built on realistic physics, deterministic multiplayer, and a moddable systems architecture. It is not a game by itself — it is a substrate on top of which entire universes can be defined.

These universes are called **Contexts**.

## What Phase Space Provides

- Newtonian and orbital physics inspired by KSP.
- Hierarchical simulation scales: interior → surface → orbital → interplanetary → interstellar.
- Deterministic lockstep multiplayer.
- An ECS-based architecture for entities and systems.
- A sandboxed scripting environment usable by both the base engine and Contexts.
- A worldgen pipeline capable of producing entire galaxies.

## What Phase Space Enables

- Infinite moddability.
- Multiple universes built on one engine.
- Nested realities (pocket dimensions, virtual constructs).
- Multiscale ship and base building.
- Player-driven automation and computing through a player scripting-runtime.

## The Flagship Context: Fold

Fold is the canonical example universe built on Phase Space, showcasing:

- Foldstones (pocket-dimension anchors)
- Fold Kernels (spacetime-regulating computational monoliths)
- Wormholes
- Seedships
- NPF (negative potential flux)
- Advanced automation via SLISP

Fold is the first universe, not the only one.
