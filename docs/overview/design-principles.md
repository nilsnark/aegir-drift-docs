# Design Principles

Aegir Drift is guided by three pillars:

## 1. Reality First

Whenever possible, physics follows real-world constraints:

- No free FTL.
- Causality preserved.
- Newtonian motion and orbital mechanics expected by players.

## 2. Modding is a First-Class Citizen

Everything — physics, tech trees, AI, progression, worldgen — is exposed through Contexts.
The engine is a substrate, not a closed box.

## 3. Nested Worlds, Clean Boundaries

Ship interiors, pocket dimensions, planetary surfaces, and orbital zones all operate on the same ruleset but with scale-appropriate simulation. Contexts can extend these without breaking the engine’s integrity.
