# The Common Lisp Fragment

A small block of code recovered from an extinct civilization millennia ago. It served as the foundation for Fold Kernel architecture.

Properties:
- Self-referential
- Perfectly stable
- Introspective
- Capable of rewriting itself safely

SLISP inherits its structure from this fragment.
