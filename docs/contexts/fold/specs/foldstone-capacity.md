# Foldstone Capacity Specification

External size determines:

- pocket volume
- structural integrity
- time-stability tolerance
- mass budget

## Inverse Capacity Law

Foldstones obey an inverse capacity rule:

> The smaller a Foldstone is in real-space, the larger its internal pocket dimension becomes.

Pocket volume increases super-linearly as external radius shrinks.
This creates tension between:

- engineering convenience (larger stones are easier to handle)
- pocket capacity (smaller stones provide exponentially more space)

This is the basis of Foldstone tier progression.

Capacity curve (draft):

$$
V_{internal} = \frac{k}{(r_{external})^3}
$$
