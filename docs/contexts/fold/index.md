# Fold Context Overview

Fold is a long‑running civilization (30,000+ years of development) that has mastered spacetime engineering through Foldstones, Fold Kernels, and a tightly‑regulated network of wormholes, seedships, and pocket dimensions.

Fold adds, on top of Core / baseline Aegir Drift:

- Foldstones and pocket dimensions
- Fold Kernels that regulate Foldspace
- NPF reactors as the exotic energy substrate
- Wormholes for causality‑safe FTL travel
- Seedships for deep‑time expansion
- SLISP as the in‑universe scripting language
- A mature NPF‑driven economy and pragmatic culture

Fold is the flagship example of what a **Context** can be.

## How to read this section

- **[Spacetime Stack](spacetime-stack.md)** – the physical and mathematical machinery: Foldstones, capacity, kernels, NPF, pockets, seedships, wormholes.
- **[Economy & Culture](economy-and-culture.md)** – how people live with this tech; the resource tiers and social norms.
- **Lore** – background universe:
  - [The Common Lisp Fragment](lore/common-lisp-fragment.md)
  - [Cosmology](lore/cosmology.md)
  - [Civilization Timeline](lore/civilization-timeline.md)
- **SLISP** – scripting language:
  - [SLISP overview and execution model](slisp.md)
  - [SLISP specification](specs/slisp-spec.md)
- **Specs & modding contracts** – low‑level details:
  - [Context Manifest schema](specs/context-manifest.md)
  - [Wormhole Protocol](specs/wormhole-protocol.md)
  - [Foldstone Capacity Model](specs/foldstone-capacity.md)

## Related engine docs

Fold leans on the general engine architecture for dimensions and simulation rules. For broader context, see:

- [Contexts Overview](../overview.md)
- Engine dimensions:
  - [Dimensions Overview](../../engine/dimensions/overview.md)
  - [Dimension Types](../../engine/dimensions/types.md)
  - [Dimension Scheduling](../../engine/dimensions/scheduling.md)
  - [Dimension Transitions](../../engine/dimensions/transitions.md)

These engine pages describe the generic mechanisms that Fold specializes with its own spacetime stack and scripting model.
