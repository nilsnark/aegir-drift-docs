# Fold Economy & Culture

Fold is not a mystical setting; it is a mature, hyper-practical civilization built around spacetime engineering.

This page groups the social and economic side of Fold: how people live with Foldstones, NPF, seedships, and wormholes.

## Economic Structure

The Fold economy centers on NPF, Foldstone mass-tier progression, and wormhole infrastructure.

### Resource Tiers

A typical progression of resource value is:

1. **Raw matter** – ores, rock, basic materials.
2. **Volatiles** – ices, gases, industrial chemicals.
3. **Exotic elements** – rare compounds needed for kernels and advanced hulls.
4. **NPF** – the exotic energy substrate that powers Foldspace (see [NPF Energy](spacetime-stack.md#npf-energy)).
5. **Kernel-grade materials** – ultra‑pure substrates used for Fold Kernels.

Gameplay / simulation loops around:

- extraction of raw matter and volatiles;
- refinement into exotic elements and NPF feedstock;
- Foldstone upgrades along discrete mass/quality tiers;
- construction and maintenance of wormholes and pocket infrastructures;
- trade across systems via seedships and wormhole networks.

NPF acts as the ultimate bottleneck and unifying currency: everything from pocket time acceleration to wormhole throat stability competes for the same energy substrate.

## Culture

Fold civilization is aggressively pragmatic. Spacetime engineering is treated as infrastructure, not mysticism.

Culturally:

- Foldstones and kernels are everyday tools, like engines or computers.
- Long time spans (centuries to millennia) are normalized by seedship missions and pocket stasis.
- Most citizens view wormholes and τ-lattices as reliable utilities rather than miracles.

The only ancient curiosity widely remembered is the ["Common Lisp Fragment"](lore/common-lisp-fragment.md), a piece of computational logic powering all Fold Kernels.

Most people are unaware of its deep significance. Engineers joke about "everything reducing to eval," but otherwise it is simply infrastructure.

## Interfaces with Other Systems

Economy and culture sit on top of the physical [spacetime stack](spacetime-stack.md) and the scripting layer provided by [SLISP](slisp.md).
