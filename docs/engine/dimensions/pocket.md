# Pocket Dimensions

Pocket Dimensions are a unique and exotic type of dimension within the Phase Space engine. They are characterized by their distinct time-dilation properties and their role as non-local interiors. Unlike traditional dimensions, Pocket Dimensions exist within Fold space, making them fundamentally different from physical spaces like ship interiors or planetary surfaces.

## Conceptual Role

Pocket Dimensions serve as specialized environments for:

- **Time-Dilated Simulations**: Events within a Pocket Dimension may progress at a different rate compared to other dimensions.
- **Fold Space Mechanics**: These dimensions are integral to Fold-based technologies and phenomena.
- **Non-Local Interiors**: They provide isolated spaces that are not bound to conventional spatial relationships.

## Default Tick Rate and Time-Dilation

- **Tick Rate**: Pocket Dimensions operate with a default tick rate optimized for their unique physics.
- **Time Dilation**: The passage of time within a Pocket Dimension can be slower or faster relative to other dimensions, depending on its configuration.

## Transitions

Transitions into and out of Pocket Dimensions are deterministic and follow well-defined rules:

1. **Entry**: Entities entering a Pocket Dimension undergo a coordinate transformation to adapt to the Fold space environment.
2. **Exit**: Entities leaving a Pocket Dimension are re-integrated into their target dimension with their state preserved.

These transitions ensure consistency and prevent state duplication or loss.
