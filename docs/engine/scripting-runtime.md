# Scripting Runtime (placeholder)

It is currently undecided whether Core-only will use SLISP or something else entirely.

The scripting runtime executes programs with:

- Deterministic evaluation
- Bounded CPU cycles
- No global state
- Strict capability permissions
- Device-local memory
- Pure functional constraints with controlled side effects
